Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering on Mall Customers Dataset.

The Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering project is an unsupervised machine learning application designed to categorize customers into meaningful groups based on their purchasing behavior. Customer segmentation is widely used in marketing, retail, mall analytics, and e-commerce platforms to better understand different types of shoppers and to deliver more personalized business strategies. This project uses the well-known Mall Customers Dataset, which includes demographic and spending-related attributes that can reveal hidden patterns within customer profiles.

The workflow begins with loading the dataset using Pandas followed by comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA). Visual tools such as pairplots, distribution graphs, and a correlation heatmap help identify relationships among features like Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. Outlier detection techniques using boxplots ensure the data is clean and suitable for clustering. The dataset is then refined by selecting the most relevant features for segmentation—primarily Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1–100)—as these represent a customer’s financial capability and shopping engagement level.

Before applying clustering, the features are scaled using StandardScaler to ensure all values operate on a comparable scale. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method, which analyzes the reduction in inertia across different values of k, and the Silhouette Score, which evaluates how well each point fits within its assigned cluster. These methods help identify the most meaningful number of customer segments.

Once the ideal number of clusters is determined, the K-Means algorithm is applied to group customers based on their income and spending behavior. This results in clearly distinguishable clusters such as high-income/high-spending customers, low-income/low-spending customers, average buyers, and outliers with unique patterns. These clusters are visualized using scatter plots that reveal distinct purchasing profiles. The final stage involves generating a cluster summary table, highlighting each segment’s average income, spending tendencies, and demographic characteristics. These insights can help businesses with targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, pricing strategies, store layout optimization, and customer retention planning.

This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of an unsupervised ML solution including data preprocessing, visualization, feature selection, clustering, evaluation, and business interpretation. Implemented using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, this project serves as a strong portfolio piece showcasing analytical thinking, technical skills, and the ability to extract actionable insights from data
